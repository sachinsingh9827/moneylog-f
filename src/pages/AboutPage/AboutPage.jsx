        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          MoneyLog helps you track your financial transactions in a simple and
          organized manner. Record each transaction and monitor its status,
          whether it's paid or pending.
        </p>

        <h2>Manage Your Transactions</h2>
        <p>
          You can add, update, or delete transactions anytime. Each transaction
          is identified by a unique transaction ID for easy tracking.
        </p>

        <h2>Stay Updated</h2>
        <p>
          Receive notifications for pending payments, so you never miss an
          update on your finances.
